These are project pages that have some unique quality which makes them good candidates for testing:

File names contain whitespace:
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/229

Complex file structure:
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/309

No directories:
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/228

Main files with comments containing "@",":"
Can fool too general of a regular expression:
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/438

Atypical uses of cat such as redirecting the output;
backslash appears in a catted filename (file should be ignored);
project title contains a forward slash;
indented terminal output:
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/208

Another cat redirect:
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/274

Contains non-text project files:
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/78
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/220
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/242

All files are not in the same root directory (advanced tasks have separate directory):
https://intranet.hbtn.io/projects/249
